Will it take a little, lot, or absurd amount of work to build this feature/design? 
If it was just a vector based illustration, it would be easy to create this divider by using an SVG image. However if the client insists on the image, it will be much more complicated.
Are there other options for similar result with less work?
Yes. An alternative option could be making simple curved bottom angles using CSS.
Is it a good development choice? Do you have any concerns with it?
Both options a pretty simple. However, CSS is more limited and cannot create that waves shape the client/designer wants.
What would be the first dev step you would try when building? Ex: “Add border radius to curve the edges” or “Something with SVGs”. This doesn't have to be terribly specific, just do your best. 
Creating an SVG file would be the simplest way to get that nice and curved edge. It is easy to make responsive across browsers.
